we need a build tool to make our lives easier when working with threee js

most popular is WebPack
most appreciated is Vite which is less prone to bugs and provides a better Experience

so we are gonna use Vite ....

Vite is Build Tool

we will write cide like HTML/ CSS/ JS and Vite will build the final website

It'll do a bunch of things

Vite handles most basic needs, but we can add plugins in order to handle more features like exotic languages or special files

we also need to install node js, which will install npm which is the node package manager
