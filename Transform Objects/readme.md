There are 4 properties to transform an object

#Position
Just changing the position in x, y and z axis

#Scale
Just changing the Scale in x, y and z axis

#rotation
Just changing the Rotation in x, y and z axis

#Quaternion
Quaternions are used in three. js to represent rotations. Iterating through a Quaternion instance will yield its components (x, y, z, w) in the corresponding order. Note that three. js expects Quaternions to be normalized.

These Properties will be compiled in Matrices
